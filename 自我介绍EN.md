Hello interviewer, I am Zhao Hongfei, a graduate student majoring in data science and machine learning from the National University of Singapore. I majored in mathematics and applied mathematics at Zhejiang University as an undergraduate.

In the first half of this year, I spent 5 months as an intern in the Data Science team of ByteDance . I mainly participated in three projects, namely user growth, APP ranking, and the development of a data product.

- The app I was responsible for is called the Lark Suite. The Lark Suite is a business-oriented collaborative office software. For to-B product in China, User Growth is a very important direction of the development of the product. The project I was doing is called Precision Operation. The job I mainly did was to use user features and historical labels got from the operation teams to build a binary classification machine learning model to mine more valuable users. 
- The second project is called App Ranking. The purpose of this project is to improve the click through rate(CTR) of 9 apps on the first screen of the app store inside the Lark Suite. After model comparision, we finally chose the ranking model GBDT+LR and it increased click through rate by 5%.

In addition to the internship of ByteDance, I also worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Statistics of Zhejiang University and participated in two deep learning related projects in computer vision and natural language processing.

In normal life, I am a cheerful and optimistic person. After studying and working, I prefer sports and music. I usually go swimming, running or playing badminton. Also, I occasionally play the guitar and I like to sing. I am happy when I do these things and relax in this way. That's all about myself, thank u.
